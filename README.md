Cyverse DElite
======================
:star: Star us on GitHub â€” it helps!

Cyverse DElite is a demonstration of Django combined with the Discovery Environment.
It is a useful resource to anyone looking to use the Discovery Environment API in their own
django/python project. The backend is coded in Python/Django, the front-end is coded in modern javascript.
The aim of this project is to mock elements of the real Discovery Environment, hence the name, DElite.
